# global-ocd_combat

Example python scripts on how to perform Combat correction on imaging data from the global OCD study.
scripts are based on the neurocombat pipeline found here: https://github.com/Jfortin1/neuroCombat ( for extracted data, e.g. volume, thickness )
and on neuroharmonize (= Combat GAM) found here: https://github.com/rpomponio/neuroHarmonize (for voxelwise data, i.e. 3D images)
